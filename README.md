# What is it?

Ever wanted a short reminder? With YoAfter you can remind yourself with a Yo with 3 reminders.

- YOAFTERANHOUR - Yo's you after an hour.
- YOAFTER30MIN - Yo's you after 30 minutes.
- YOAFTER15MIN  - Yo's you after 15 minutes.

# Uses

* remember to take out the laundry once it's finished?
* as a kitchen timer?
* ...the possibilities are endless.

# How to use it?

Just send a Yo to any one of the accounts, Yoafter will reply back after the respective time interval.

# Tip

Make a shortcut on your homescreen for all these accounts for quick access.


Note:

* I've not included apikeys.py to prevent abuse of the system. The callbacks are also secret. 
* The Yo Api is restricted to one yo per recipient per minute. You can't receive two 15 min reminders in the same minute.
